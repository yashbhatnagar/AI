Implementation of AI algorithms
Adversarial Search: 
Predicting the next best move for a board game called- “Gomoku” as per any given current board state using greedy, Minimax, Alpha-Beta algorithms and an evaluation function. Language used: Python
Inference in First Order Logic: 
For a given Knowledge Base and a Query used backward-chaining algorithm to determine if the query can be inferred from the Knowledge Base. Language used: Python
Bayesian Inference: 
used variable elimination or enumeration strategies to calculate joint probabilities, marginal probabilities, or conditional probabilities in order to do inference in a Bayesian network. Language used: Python
